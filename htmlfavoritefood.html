        My 1st favorite food is Fuchka. it is a Bangladeshi, Indian or Pakistani famouse street food. There are different names for it,Some people call it Pani Puri, fuchka, or gulgappe. The food is hot with spicy tarmarind water. There is also two types of Fuchka one is with yogurt and one without yogurt. You also can usally see it in most of the Indian/Bangladeshi weddings.

      My most favorite food is Samyang Carbo Spicy Ramen noodles.It's Korean ramen nooles. It comes with 1 small packet of spicy sauce and 1 small packet of white powder which makes the ramen more testier and a little sweeter.

    <h3>I love the flavor of the white powder, it kind of taste like garlic powder.</h3>

      <li>Love the flavor</li>
      <li>Spicy</li>
      <li>little bit of sweet</li>
